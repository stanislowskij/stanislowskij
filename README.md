# Hello!

My name is Jaydon *(he/him)*, or Jay for short (for comedic value, I often go by `/Jay(?:don)?/`).

- 🎓 I'm a second-year undergraduate student and teaching assistant of computer science at the University of Minnesota - Morris.
- 🎵 I love learning, planets, music (of all kinds), math, and cats.
- ☕ I have some experience in Java, back-end development and client-server architecture, and am looking to expand my skills in these areas.

I don't have much going on yet, but I'm excited to post updates about what I'm up to here once I get around to it.
